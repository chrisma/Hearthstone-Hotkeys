# Hearthstone-Hotkeys

*WARNING: due to Blizzard making resolutions arbitrary, this tool no longer works, it will be updated as soon as I find some time.*

AutoHotkey script providing hotkeys / shortcuts for Blizzard's CCG [Hearthstone][1].
It automates common actions (such a ending the turn) and provides a fullscreen borderless mode, allowing faster switching between windows and overlaying extra windows.

## Hotkeys
Key | Function
--- | ---
Middle-click,  Ctrl+Space, Ctrl+Enter | End turn
Ctrl+click | Target enemy avatar
F1, Numpad1, NumpadEnd | Emote "Greetings"
F2, Numpad2, NumpadDown | Emote "Well Played"
F3, Numpad3, NumpadPageDown | Emote "Thanks"
F4, Numpad4, NumpadLeft | Emote "Sorry"
F5, Numpad5, NumpadClear | Emote "Oops"
F6, Numpad6, NumpadRight | Emote "Threaten"
F12 | Toggle borderless fullscreen mode

## Usage
1. [Download][2] and run the compiled executable "Hearthstone_hotkeys.exe" (if you trust me)

    __or__

2. * Install [AutoHotkey][3]
    * Run the .ahk file (double click on it / drag it onto the Autohotkey executable)

A message will pop up, that Hearthstone Hotkeys is running.
The script lives in the taskbar and can be quit from there.
